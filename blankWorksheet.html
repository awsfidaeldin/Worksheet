			// JavaScript Practice Worksheet

			// For this assignment, follow the instructions to learn more
			// about objects, loops, and functions. At the bottom, I have written
			// a lot of text to help you through this assignment.


			// 1) Create a new object and assign it to a variable named user.



			// 2) Now, add the following properties to our user object, and fill in the values
			// with your information. If you do not have favorite foods, siblings, or degrees,
			// then just put an empty array as the value.

				// name of type string
				// age of type number
				// height of type number in inches
				// eyeColor of type string
				// hairColor of type string
				// favoriteFoods, an array of strings of foods
				// favoriteColors, an array of strings of colors
				// siblings, an array of objects, each with name and age properties
				// degrees, an array of objects, each with school, degreeName, and gpa properties
				// hobbies, an array of strings



			// 3) Now, create a function called inspectUser that has one argument, a user object.
			//		a) pass in the user to our inspectObject function. Save the result to
			//		   variable called userElement
			//		b) Append userElement to the document
			//		c) That's all this function does :)



			// 4) Create another function called inspectArray with one parameter that
			//    will be an array.
			//		a) Create a <ul> and save it to a variable called ul.
			//		b) Give this ul a class name of "array"
			//		c) Create a for loop and loop over every item in the array
			//		 	1) Create an <li> item, and save it to a variable called li.
			//			2) Write an if statement. If the array at the current index is
			//    		   an instanceof Array, then do the following.
			//  				a) pass the array item at the current index into inspectArray
			//  		   		   and save what the function returns to a variable named
			//  		   		   arrayElement.
			//  				b) append arrayElement to your li.
		 	// 			3) Write an else if state. If the array at the current index is
		 	// 	   		   an instanceof Object, then do the following.
		 	// 	   	    		a) pass the array item at the current index into inspectObject
		 	// 	   	       		   and save what the function returns to a variable named
		 	// 	   	       		   objectElement.
		 	// 	   	    		b) append objectElement to your li.
		 	// 			4) Write an else statement. We know that the array item is not an
		 	// 	   		   array or an object, so it must be a plain old number or string.
		 	// 	   		   Set the textContent of our li to the value of the array at the
		 	// 	   		   current index.
		 	// 			5) Append the li to our ul
		 	// 		e) Lastly, return the ul element. We don't want to append it, because
			//    	   inspectUser will append everything when we're all done here.
			


			// 4) Create another function called inspectObject with one parameter that
			//    will be an object.
			//		a) Create a <ul> and save it to a variable called ul.
			//		b) Give this ul a class name of "object"
			//		c) Create a for in loop and loop over each property in the object
			//		 	1) Create an <li> item, and save it to a variable called li.
			//  		2) Create a <span> tag, and save it to a variable called propertyNameSpan.
			//  		3) Create a <span> tag, and save it to a variable called valueSpan.
			//  		4) Append the propertyNameSpan to our li.
			//  		5) Append the valueNameSpan to our li.
			//  		6) Now lets set the textContent of our propertyNameSpan to the current property name.
			//			
			//			7) Write an if statement. If the value at the current property on our object is
			//			    an instanceof Array, then do the following.
			//  				a) pass the array item at the current index into inspectArray
			//  		   		   and save what the function returns to a variable named
			//  		   		   arrayElement.
			//  				b) append arrayElement to your li.
			// 			8) Write an else if state. If the value at the current property on our object is
			// 	   		   an instanceof Object, then do the following.
		 	// 	   	    		a) pass the array item at the current index into inspectObject
		 	// 	   	       		   and save what the function returns to a variable named
		 	// 	   	       		   objectElement.
		 	// 	   	    		b) append objectElement to your li.
		 	// 			4) Write an else statement. We know that the value is not an
		 	// 	   		   array or an object, so it must be a plain old number or string.
		 	// 	   		   Set the textContent of our li to the value of the current property on our object.
		 	// 			5) Append the li to our ul
		 	// 		e) Lastly, return the ul element. We don't want to append it, because
			//    	   inspectUser will append everything when we're all done here.





			// Great! Now, try and running inspectUser and pass in your user object. Like this.
			// inspectUser(user);
			// it should print everytihng to the document

Learning about instanceof
=========================

Remember how I said that everything has a type? Whether it be boolean, string,
number, Object, null, or undefined? Well, javascript has a way to identify
what kind of specific object you're looking at. For this exercise, we will need
to perform instanceof checks, to make sure that an argument is either an Object
or an Array.

But wait a second, I thought you said Arrays ARE Objects. And you would be correct.
Arrays are a sub class of Object, that means they have inherited all of Objects
properties. Let's look below at how to do instanceof checks.

var myArray = [];
myArray instanceof Array // true
myArray instanceof Object // true

var myObject = {};
myObject instanceof Array // false
myObject instanceof Object // true

From the above code, we can tell that arrays are both an instance of Array AND an
instance of Object. That's because Array is inherited from Object. Let's take a
real world example to better understand this.

In the animal world, we have all kinds of mammals, reptiles, insects, birds, and
other species. In a more specific case, let's imagine a monkey. Now, imagine a
monkey was a cool javascript class, and let's run the following checks.

var myMonkey = new Monkey
myMonkey instanceof Monkey // true
myMonkey instanceof Mammal // true
myMonkey instanceof Animal // true
myMonkey instanceof Organism // true

From this example, we can see how a monkey actually fits into several different
categories. And monkeys inherit characteristics from each step up the chain. It
has the properties of a mammal, an animal, and an organism, and more specifically
a monkey. Now let's look at this situation.

var animal = new Animal
animal instanceof Monkey // false
animal instanceof Animal // true
animal instanceof Organism // true

Animal is higher up than monkey, so this makes sense.

Well the same applies to arrays and objects. At the very highest level, we have
Objects. Everything extends (or descends) from an Object. The same way a monkey
can be considered both a monkey AND a mammal, arrays are both an Array AND an Object.

When we create arrays, they are both an Array AND an Object, but an Object is NOT an
Array, it is just an Object.

An Object or an Array are known as a Class in computer science. You can create
many instances of a single Class. For example, cars have blueprints that define how
to build a car. A Class is like that blueprint. When we build a new car, we have
created a new instance of a car blueprint. When we create a new array, we are creating
a new instance of the Array class. That is the entire purpose of the "new" keyword
in javascript. It creates a new instance of a class.

Up until now, we have been using mostly literal notation, like below.

var myString = "hello!";
var myArray = [1,2,3];
var myObj = {}

But, you can also do the same thing with the code below.

var myString = new String;
var myArray = new Array;
var myObj = new Object;

That's because everytime we create something, we are creating instances of a Class.

Pretty neat!

Now how do I use instanceof checks?

In the following code, we're going to validate an argument of a function.


function validateArray(someArray){
	if(someArray instanceof Array){
		console.log("This is a real array");
	} else {
		console.log("Imposter! This is not a real array!");
	}
}

function validateObject(someObject){
	if(someObject instanceof Object){
		console.log("This is a real object");
	} else {
		console.log("Imposter! This is not a real object!");
	}
}

Now for the code we are trying to create above, we are trying to make generic functions
that can handle anything that comes its way. That's why we need to check if we're
dealing with an Object, Array, or some other type.

Good luck!

Learning about for loops 
========================

For loops are used to iterate over items in an array, or properties in an object.
The former is a traditional for loop while the latter is a special loop known as a
for in loop. Below are examples of how to use both.


var myArray = ['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi'];


	    initialize         the condition			 this last statement is what
	    i to 0			think "for as long as..."    happens at the end of each cycle.
	                              					 It increments i by 1.
        
for(	var i = 0; 		i < myArray.length; 		i++){
	console.log(myArray[i]);
}

This will log, "banana apple kiwi" to the log.

Things to remember:
	- .length tells us how many things are in the array, in this case, 3
	- Arrays are 0 based, so myArray[0] (read as, myArray at index 0)
	  would be banana, myArray[1] is apple, and myArray[2] is kiwi.



Cool, thats about all there is to traditional loops. Now the for in loop. Check out the
sample below.

var myObject = {
	name: "Seth!",
	age: 26
}


	initialize a,					This is our object
	which will be 					that we will access
	assigned different   			inside the loop
	property names
	at each cycle.

for(	var a 			in 			myObject){
	console.log(myObject[a]);
}


When we look at this loop, the variable a is taking the name of each property in the object.
So, in the first pass, a = "name". Then, we can access the value of the property by using
bracket notation on the object. That looks like this. myObject["name"]. That statement gives
us the value stored in the object, which would be "Seth". The a variable will change to each
property name as the loop cycles. That's how we're able to access all the values of the object
using a for in loop.

Good luck!

Using jQuery 
============

For this exercise, you should use jQuery.

As a quick reminder, here is how you achieve things in jQuery, as well as their
normal javascript equivalents.


Create HTML
***********

Normal - 	document.createElement('div'); // <div></div>
jQuery -    $('<div></div>') // <div></div>

It's important to note that you can put anything into the jQuery one and it will
create it in html. In normal JavaScript, we can only create one element at a time.
jQuery will make it much simpler to create html on the fly for you.



Appending
*********

normal - document.body.appendChild(div);
jQuery - $(document.body).append(div);

Keep in mind, div in this case is something that I created using document.createElement('div');
or $('<div></div>');


That should be all the jQuery that you need for this exercise.

Good luck!
